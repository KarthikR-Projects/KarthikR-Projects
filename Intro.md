- After viewing my id, You might be wondering what **"Kintsugi"** means? well its a Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. The philosophy is quite similar to that of **'wabi-sabi'** which means "**embracing of the flawed or imperfect**"😁✨.
