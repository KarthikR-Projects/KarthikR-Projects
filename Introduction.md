- After viewing my id, You might be wondering what *"Kintsugi"* means? well its a Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. The philosophy is quite similar to that of **'wabi-sabi'** which means **"embracing of the flawed or imperfect"** 😁✨.
